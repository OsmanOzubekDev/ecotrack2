## How It Works

### Automatic Achievement Checking

- The system tracks progress across all achievement types
- Users receive immediate feedback when new achievements are unlocked

### Progress Tracking
- Each achievement shows current progress with a visual progress bar
- Progress is calculated based on:
  - Carbon scores below specific thresholds
  - Consecutive days of tracking
  - Total number of calculations
  - Score improvements over time

### User Interface
- **Unlocked Achievements**: Displayed with green checkmarks and full opacity
- **Locked Achievements**: Displayed with progress bars showing completion percentage
- **Category Filtering**: Users can filter achievements by category (All, Carbon, Consistency, Milestones, Special)
- **Progress Visualization**: Clear progress bars and percentage indicators for locked achievements
